      		<dd>The province was heavily affected by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. Due to this, the economy of the province weakened for some time, but regained vitality a few years after the government ordered the revitalization of the province and established growth in its southern towns, which later became a significant economic zone in the country by 1995. The province of Zambales was formally organized in 1572 after its exploration by Don Juan de Salcedo, and originally included the towns of Alaminos, Bolinao, San Isidro, Infanta, Anda, Bani, and Agno, which now belong to Pangasinan. Masinloc, one of its earliest municipalities organized in 1607, was its former capital. Its earliest inhabitants are the Malays from the Celebes Sea and the kinky haired Negritos and Aetas, which are up to now present in the province, and were then referred to as “Sambali” or “Zambals.” The name of the province was derived from the Malay word “Samba” meaning to worship as the Spaniards found the its inhabitants worshipping their “Anitos.”</dd>
